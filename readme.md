Project 3 - You Spin Me Round
Group members: Aditya Sinha, Margi Katwala, and Vignan Thmmu

Our project is divided into three tabs: FIND THE UNKNOWN, IN DEPTH OF ILLINOIS, COMPARE & LEARN

The first tab: FIND THE UNKNOWN
Functionality : 
                        Select time format (12 hr and 24 hr)
                        Show graphs or show tables
                        Select injuries, fatalities, loss

First three graphs - showing the tornado (and # and % in each magnitude, including 'unknown') for each year, per month and per hour 
Fourth graph - table and chart showing the total numbers (and # and % in each magnitude) by its magnitude
Next three graph table and chart showing the injuries, fatalities, loss for each year, per month and per hour
Next graph is table and chart showing which counties were most hit by tornadoes summed over all years
Leaflet Map showing total numbers of a tornado by its distance range in meter 


The second tab: IN DEPTH OF ILLINOIS
Functionality : 
                        Select Magnitude 
                        Show graphs or show tables
                        Select Map background
                        Select filtering variable and it's value
The first map filter based on the magnitude
The second map filter depending on the filtering variable and it's value (blank if the value is 0)
The third map  top counties in IL most likely to hit by a tornado

The third tab: COMPARE & LEARN
Functionality : 
                    Show graphs or show tables
                    Select Map Background
                    Select state from the drop- down menu

If the table is selected from what to display - it will allow user to choose another state to compare with IL

Also implemented state hit by tornado by year ( user can pick a year from the drop-down menu)
